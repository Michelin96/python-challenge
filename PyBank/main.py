#creating a list of each colum of data to be analyzed

#use the month column to get the total number of months 

#  use the  "Profit/Losses"  column to caluculate the total over the entire period

#  use the "Profit/Losses" column to find the average of the changes over the entire period

#   * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

# * As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

#   Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
#   ```

# print the analysis to the terminal and export a fin_results.txt file with the results.
# fin_results.txt needs to be opened for writing and then closed after writing
